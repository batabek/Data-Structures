C++ Data Structures
=====================

Some commonly used **template data structures** written from scratch in C++.

* binarysearchtree.h : Binary Search Tree (BST) implementation.
	* DFS Traversal methods including inorder, preorder, postorder
	* insertion(both recursive and  iterative)
	* deletion(recursive)
	* search(recursive)
	* find min/max

* linklist.h: Base class for List types.
	* singlylist.h: Singly Linked List implementation. 

* stack.h: Stack data structure implementation using link list.

* queue.h: Queue data structure implementation using link list.

* iterator.h : Base class for iterator types.
	* SinglyListIterator: Iterator class for using with singly linked list.

* test: folder containing the unit tests for each data structure.
